**Edscheme** has been developed for student use by [Schemers, Inc.](http://www.schemers.com/), a small Florida company founded by two high school teachers. It has been used successfully in high schools and colleges for several years. It strives to be much more student-friendly than MIT Scheme: text is color-coded to distinguish Scheme primitives, keywords, user definitions, constants, etc.; there are dynamic reminders (as you type in your program) of expected Scheme syntax and your syntactic errors; there is point-and-click lookup of previously entered procedure definitions; and it has menu control of most features, clear error messages, and convenient online documentation.

You can [**download**](http://www.schemers.com/download.html) the EdScheme initialization files in ZIP format.  After the two-week free trial, you have to buy a copy to continue using EdScheme. It lists for $130 but is available to 6.001 students for $68.95.

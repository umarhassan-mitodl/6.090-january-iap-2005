**Edscheme** has been developed for student use by {{% resource_link "dcbb7e62-81bd-472e-b105-5c6c535fcd47" "Schemers, Inc." %}}, a small Florida company founded by two high school teachers. It has been used successfully in high schools and colleges for several years. It strives to be much more student-friendly than MIT Scheme: text is color-coded to distinguish Scheme primitives, keywords, user definitions, constants, etc.; there are dynamic reminders (as you type in your program) of expected Scheme syntax and your syntactic errors; there is point-and-click lookup of previously entered procedure definitions; and it has menu control of most features, clear error messages, and convenient online documentation.

You can {{% resource_link "3ed48ffa-5909-4262-a2ee-5545b3ddc2f9" "**download**" %}} the EdScheme initialization files in ZIP format.  After the two-week free trial, you have to buy a copy to continue using EdScheme. It lists for $130 but is available to 6.001 students for $68.95.
